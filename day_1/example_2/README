Objective: Expand previous example to include dependencies and introduce Makefile variables

Method:
    Delegate the message to a seperate function, and push it to its own files.
    C++ concepts:
        - introduce preprocessor include guards
        - introduce namespace concept
        - header vs implementation files
        - preprocessor macros and conditional inclusion
    Makefile concepts:
        (in Makefile)
        - multiple dependencies
        - compiling objects vs linking executables
        (in Makefile2)
        - user defined variables in Make
        - automatic variables in Make {$^, $<, $@, $(RM)}
        (in Makefile3)
        - target rules '%.o: %.cxx' to automatically convert '*.cxx' into '*.o'
          -- this allows make to implicitly handle compilation the way you want it
          -- make actually defines these, but you might want to explicitly list them
        - Use $(RM) instead of `rm -f`
